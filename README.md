# Vanilla JavaScript REST Api using NODEjs

[TOC]

REST api tutorial I followed from Traversy Media "[Vanilla Node.js REST API | No Framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1xa8Bsho6A&t=2939s)".

For reference [HTML Status Codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).

I followed the tutorial to get this working then added the necessary stuff so that it would run in docker.

## Start

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the server listening on port `5000` or whatever port number is supplied for `process.env.PORT`.

Currently returns a `200` status code with the json from the products.json file.

**_NOTE_**

I will be updating README with additional information as the project progresses.
